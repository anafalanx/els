rem ============================================================================
rem  els ignition - the ONE non-Tcl tooling file.
rem
rem  els lives INSIDE the mal folder and pins a shared, read-only toolchain
rem  bundle by name (toolchain.pin, one line, e.g. tika26b). This script
rem  DISCOVERS that bundle in mal's store by walking ancestors for
rem    <ancestor>\X\<pin>\BUNDLE.manifest
rem  so the whole tree is location-agnostic (mal can sit anywhere and be renamed),
rem  puts the bundle's Tcl/Tk 9 + gcc on PATH, then hands off to the Tcl task
rem  runner. Everything else is Tcl (or C built by the bundle's gcc).
rem  Usage:  x <command> [args]   (run `x help`)
rem
rem  Double-clicking x.cmd (or `x shell`) drops you into a shell with the bundle
rem  on PATH. The bundle is read ONLY; els writes nothing outside this folder.
rem
rem  Flow is goto-based on purpose: no parenthesized blocks wrap %PATH% vars, so a
rem  ')' in the folder path (e.g. an Explorer "els (1)" copy) can't break parsing.
