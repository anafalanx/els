# Tcl_UpVar

*Tcl Library Procedures*

## NAME

Tcl_UpVar, Tcl_UpVar2 - link one variable to another

## SYNOPSIS

```
#include <tcl.h>

int
Tcl_UpVar(interp, frameName, sourceName, destName, flags)

int
Tcl_UpVar2(interp, frameName, name1, name2, destName, flags)
```

## ARGUMENTS

- **`Tcl_Interp *interp`** *(in)*
Interpreter containing variables;  also used for error reporting.

- **`const char *frameName`** *(in)*
Identifies the stack frame containing source variable. May have any of the forms accepted by the **upvar** command, such as **#0** or **1**.

- **`const char *sourceName`** *(in)*
Name of source variable, in the frame given by *frameName*. May refer to a scalar variable or to an array variable with a parenthesized index.

- **`const char *destName`** *(in)*
Name of destination variable, which is to be linked to source variable so that references to *destName* refer to the other variable.  Must not currently exist except as an upvar-ed variable.

- **`int flags`** *(in)*
One of **TCL_GLOBAL_ONLY**, **TCL_NAMESPACE_ONLY** or 0;  if non-zero, then *destName* is a global or namespace variable;  otherwise it is local to the current procedure (or current namespace if no procedure is active).

- **`const char *name1`** *(in)*
First part of source variable's name (scalar name, or name of array without array index).

- **`const char *name2`** *(in)*
If source variable is an element of an array, gives the index of the element. For scalar source variables, is NULL.

## DESCRIPTION

**Tcl_UpVar** and **Tcl_UpVar2** provide the same functionality as the **upvar** command:  they make a link from a source variable to a destination variable, so that references to the destination are passed transparently through to the source. The name of the source variable may be specified either as a single string such as **xyx** or **a(24)** (by calling **Tcl_UpVar**) or in two parts where the array name has been separated from the element name (by calling **Tcl_UpVar2**). The destination variable name is specified in a single string;  it may not be an array element.

Both procedures return either **TCL_OK** or **TCL_ERROR**, and they leave an error message in the interpreter's result if an error occurs.

As with the **upvar** command, the source variable need not exist; if it does exist, unsetting it later does not destroy the link.  The destination variable may exist at the time of the call, but if so it must exist as a linked variable.
