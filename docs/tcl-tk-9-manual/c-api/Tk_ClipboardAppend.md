# Tk_ClipboardClear

*Tk Library Procedures*

## NAME

Tk_ClipboardClear, Tk_ClipboardAppend - Manage the clipboard

## SYNOPSIS

```
#include <tk.h>

int
Tk_ClipboardClear(interp, tkwin)

int
Tk_ClipboardAppend(interp, tkwin, target, format, buffer)
```

## ARGUMENTS

- **`Tcl_Interp *interp`** *(in)*
Interpreter to use for reporting errors.

- **`Tk_Window tkwin`** *(in)*
Window that determines which display's clipboard to manipulate.

- **`Atom target`** *(in)*
Conversion type for this clipboard item;  has same meaning as *target* argument to **Tk_CreateSelHandler**.

- **`Atom format`** *(in)*
Representation to use when data is retrieved;  has same meaning as *format* argument to **Tk_CreateSelHandler**.

- **`const char *buffer`** *(in)*
Null terminated string containing the data to be appended to the clipboard.

## DESCRIPTION

These two procedures manage the clipboard for Tk. The clipboard is typically managed by calling **Tk_ClipboardClear** once, then calling **Tk_ClipboardAppend** to add data for any number of targets.

**Tk_ClipboardClear** claims the CLIPBOARD selection and frees any data items previously stored on the clipboard in this application. It normally returns **TCL_OK**, but if an error occurs it returns **TCL_ERROR** and leaves an error message in interpreter *interp*'s result. **Tk_ClipboardClear** must be called before a sequence of **Tk_ClipboardAppend** calls can be issued.

**Tk_ClipboardAppend** appends a buffer of data to the clipboard. The first buffer for a given *target* determines the *format* for that *target*. Any successive appends for that *target* must have the same format or an error will be returned. **Tk_ClipboardAppend** returns **TCL_OK** if the buffer is successfully copied onto the clipboard.  If the clipboard is not currently owned by the application, either because **Tk_ClipboardClear** has not been called or because ownership of the clipboard has changed since the last call to **Tk_ClipboardClear**, **Tk_ClipboardAppend** returns **TCL_ERROR** and leaves an error message in the result of interpreter *interp*.

In order to guarantee atomicity, no event handling should occur between **Tk_ClipboardClear** and the following **Tk_ClipboardAppend** calls (otherwise someone could retrieve a partially completed clipboard or claim ownership away from this application).

**Tk_ClipboardClear** may invoke callbacks, including arbitrary Tcl scripts, as a result of losing the CLIPBOARD selection, so any calling function should take care to be re-entrant at the point **Tk_ClipboardClear** is invoked.
