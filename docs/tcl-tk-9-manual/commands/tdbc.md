*Tcl Database Connectivity*

## NAME

tdbc - Tcl Database Connectivity

## SYNOPSIS

```
package require tdbc 1.0
package require tdbc::driver version

tdbc::driver::connection create db ?-option value...?
```

## DESCRIPTION

Tcl Database Connectivity (TDBC) is a common interface for Tcl programs to access SQL databases. It is implemented by a series of database *drivers*: separate modules, each of which adapts Tcl to the interface of one particular database system.  All of the drivers implement a common series of commands for manipulating the database. These commands are all named dynamically, since they all represent objects in the database system. They include **connections,** which represent connections to a database; **statements,** which represent SQL statements, and **result sets,** which represent the sets of rows that result from executing statements. All of these have manual pages of their own, listed under **SEE ALSO**.

In addition, TDBC itself has a few service procedures that are chiefly of interest to driver writers. **SEE ALSO** also enumerates them.
